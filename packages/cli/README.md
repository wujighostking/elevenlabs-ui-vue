## Overview

[ElevenLabs UI Vue](https://elevenlabs-ui-vue.com) provides pre-built, customizable Vue components specifically designed for agent & audio applications, including orbs, waveforms, voice agents, audio players, and more.
The CLI makes it easy to add these components to your Vue and Nuxt project.

## Installation
You can use the ElevenLabs UI Vue CLI directly with npx, or install it globally:

```bash
# Use directly (recommended)
npx elevenlabs-ui-vue@latest add <component-name>

# Or using shadcn-vue cli
npx shadcn-vue@latest add https://registry.elevenlabs-ui-vue.com/all.json
```

## Prerequisites
Before using ElevenLabs UI Vue, ensure your project meets these requirements:
- **Node.js 18** or later
- **shadcn-vue** initialized in your project (npx shadcn-vue@latest init)
- **Tailwind CSS** configured

## Usage

```bash
npx elevenlabs-ui-vue@latest
```
This command will:
