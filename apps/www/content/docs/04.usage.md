description: How to use ElevenLabs UI Vue components in your application.
---

Once an ElevenLabs UI Vue component is installed, you can import it and use it in your application like any other Vue component. The components are added as part of your codebase (not hidden in a library), so you can edit the components to suit your specific needs.

## Example

After installing ElevenLabs UI Vue components, you can use them in your application like any other Vue component. For example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Card } from "@repo/shadcn-vue/components/ui/card"
import { Orb } from "@/components/elevenlabs-ui/orb"
</script>

<template>
  <Card class="flex items-center justify-center p-8">
    <Orb />
  </Card>
</template>
```
